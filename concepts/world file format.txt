The deafault world will be in resources directory, the save files (modified
world files) will be in separate save folder.

There will be sections, like terrains, npcs, tiles etc. Each sections looks like this:

section_name
data_lines
end

These sections can be in any order and some of them can even be missing but there must
not be one sections more than once.

data_lines is a variable number of lines of definitions.

The sections are:

npcs - NPC definitions

tiles - world tiles definition, the data lines look like this:
  id_int name_string priority_int variants_int animated_bool steppable_bool flyable_bool swimmable_bool

  id_int is unique integer id, name_string is the tile name, priority_int is integer
  priority which affects the tile overlapping, variants_int is the number of tile
  variants (if the tile is not animated) or number of frames (if the tile is animated),
  animated_bool says if the tile is animated (T or F), steppable_bool says if the tile
  is steppable (T or F) and flyable says if the tile can be flight over (T or F),
  similarly swimmable_bool

terrain - world terrain definition, the first data line is width, the second one is
  height and the the following lines represent lines of the terrain, which consist
  of tile_id variant alternating numbers

interiors - defines interiors, each data line looks like this:
  id_int name_string width_int height_int tile_data
  tile_data is the same as the terrain tile data

items - item definitions

objects - object definitions
