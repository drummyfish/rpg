There will be sections, like terrains, npcs, tiles etc. Each sections looks like this:

section_name
data_lines
end

data_lines is a variable number of lines of definitions.

The sections are:

npcs - NPC definitions

tiles - world tiles definition, the data lines look like this:
  id_int name_string priority_int variants_int animated_bool steppable_bool flyable_bool 

  id_int is unique integer id, name_string is the tile name, priority_int is integer
  priority which affects the tile overlapping, variants_int is the number of tile
  variants (if the tile is not animated) or number of frames (if the tile is animated),
  animated_bool says if the tile is animated (T or F), steppable_bool says if the tile
  is steppable (T or F) and flyable says if the tile can be flight over (T or F)

terrain - world terrain definition, the first data line is width, the second one is
  height and the third one contains the terrain data, which consist of id numbers of
  tiles separated by spaces

items - item definitions

objects - object definitions

1 "water" 0  4 T F T
2 "road"  5  3 F T T
